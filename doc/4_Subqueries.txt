Two types of subqueries

	-Self-contained subqueries
	-Correlated subqueries
	
	-Self-contained: no dependency on the outer query that it belongs to
	-Correlated: dependence on outer query
	
	A subquery can be single-valued, multivalued, or table-valued
	
	Self-contained subqueries
		NB: Logically, it’s as if the subquery code is evaluated only once before the outer query is 
		evaluated, and then the outer query uses the result of the subquery
		single-valued,
			A scalar subquery is a subquery that returns a single value—regardless of whether it is self-contained
				Can appear anywhere in an outer query where a single-valued expression can appear (single-valued expression = returns a scalar[one value])
				For it to be valid it must return a single value
				Use in expression of =,<>, <,>. <=,>=
				If a scalar subquery returns no value, it returns a NULL
			
		multivalued
			A multivalued subquery is a subquery that returns multiple values as a single column, regardless of
			whether the subquery is self-contained
			
			Predicates that operate on mutlivalued subqueries
				IN
				SOME,ANY,ALL (All 3 very rarely used)
				
				IN : <scalar_expression> IN (<multivalued subquery>) [<multivalued subquery> = column of values	]
				
	Correlated subqueries
		These are subqueries that refer to attributes of the outer query, thus dependent on the outer query
		NB: Logically, it’s as if the subquery is evaluated separately for each outer row
		

NB: Remember to use Aliases for tables
NB: A subquery is like a function. You call it and it return a value or values which you can use in a Boolean expression(A predicate)
