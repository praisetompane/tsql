--TABLE EXPRESSIONS
	--Benefit of Table Expressions: You can refer to the column names of the inner query(Even those in the SELECT clause) anywhere in the outer clause

	--1. DERIVED TABLE EXPRESSIONS
		--For example, suppose that you need to write a query against the Sales.Orders table and return the
		--number of distinct customers handled in each order year

			--First Logical version
			USE TSQL2012;
			SELECT  COUNT (DISTINCT Custid) AS NUMCUSTSID, YEAR(orderdate) AS ORDERYEAR
			FROM Sales.Orders
			GROUP BY YEAR(orderdate) -- This works well if the expression is short, you can just repeat it.
									 -- If the formula is long, this might cause bugs and code unrealiability

			--Table expression alternative
			USE TSQL2012;
			SELECT NUMCUSTID,ORDRTBLEXPRESSION.ORDERYEAR
			FROM (SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS ORDERYEAR, COUNT (DISTINCT custid) AS NUMCUSTID
				  FROM Sales.Orders
				  GROUP BY YEAR(orderdate)) AS ORDRTBLEXPRESSION	
			--The inner query (Table expresion is handling the query work and outer one is just displaying)
			--Note: This is still incorrect, you repeated GROUP BY YEAR(orderdate)

			--Book table expression alternative [BETTER ALTERNATIVE]
			SELECT orderyear, COUNT(DISTINCT custid) AS numcusts
			FROM (SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear, custid
				  FROM Sales.Orders) AS D
			GROUP BY orderyear;

			--SQL server will still expand the query to[Stressing that Table Expression are more for Logical Code and not for Peformance]:

				--SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear, COUNT(DISTINCT custid) AS numcusts
				--FROM Sales.Orders
				--GROUP BY YEAR(orderdate);

		--USING ARGUMENTS 

			DECLARE @empid AS INT = 3;
			SELECT orderyear, COUNT(DISTINCT custid) AS numcusts
			FROM (SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear, custid
				  FROM Sales.Orders
				  WHERE empid = @empid) AS D
			GROUP BY orderyear;

			--TEST -- You can refer to arguments in normal queries as well
			use TSQL2012;
			DECLARE @empid2 AS INT = 3;
			SELECT custid, orderid, empid
					FROM Sales.Orders
			WHERE empid = @empid2;

		--NESTING

			--For example, the code in Listing 5-2 returns order years and the number of customers handled in
			--each year only for years in which more than 70 customers were handled.

			--Return Order years
			--Num customers handled each year
			--Years more 70 customers handled

			--USE TSQL2012;
			--SELECT ORDRYEAR , COUNT (custid) AS numCusts
			--FROM (SELECT YEAR (orderdate) AS ORDRYEAR,custid  
			--	  FROM Sales.Orders) AS ORDRS
			--WHERE numCusts > 70
			--GROUP BY ORDRYEAR

			--USE TSQL2012;

		
			--SELECT COUNT(custid) numInstance, custid 
			--FROM Sales.Orders
			--GROUP BY  

			SELECT ORDRYEAR,NUMCUSTS
			FROM (SELECT ORDRYEAR, COUNT(custid) AS NUMCUSTS 
				  FROM (SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS ORDRYEAR, custid
					  FROM Sales.Orders) AS YEARCUSTS
				  GROUP BY(ORDRYEAR)
				  ) AS TOTALCUSTSANDYEAR
			WHERE NUMCUSTS > 70

			--Book solution
			SELECT orderyear, numcusts
			FROM (SELECT orderyear, COUNT(DISTINCT custid) AS numcusts -- DO NOT FORGET THE DISTINCT	
				  FROM (SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear, custid
						FROM Sales.Orders) AS D1
				  GROUP BY orderyear) AS D2
			WHERE numcusts > 70;

			--The whole purpose of using table expressions in this example was to simplify the solution by reusing
			--column aliases instead of repeating expressions.
			--NB: The nesting increases complexity, repeating expresssions like below actually work better. (The Length of the expression is
			--the defining factor for whether to use Nesting(derived tables) or repeat expression)

			--Alternative
			SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear, COUNT(DISTINCT custid) AS numcusts
			FROM Sales.Orders
			GROUP BY YEAR(orderdate)
			HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT custid) > 70;
		
		--MULTIPLE REFERENCES
			--Another problematic aspect of derived tables stems from the fact that derived tables are defined in
			--the FROM clause of the outer query and not prior to the outer query. As far as the FROM clause of
			--the outer query is concerned, the derived table doesn�t exist yet; therefore, if you need to refer to
			--multiple instances of the derived table, you can�t. Instead, you have to define multiple derived tables
			--based on the same query. The query in Listing 5-3 provides an example.
		SELECT Cur.orderyear,
		Cur.numcusts AS curnumcusts, Prv.numcusts AS prvnumcusts,
		Cur.numcusts - Prv.numcusts AS growth
		FROM (SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear,COUNT(DISTINCT custid) AS numcusts
			  FROM Sales.Orders
			  GROUP BY YEAR(orderdate)) AS Cur
		LEFT OUTER JOIN
			(SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear, COUNT(DISTINCT custid) AS numcusts
			 FROM Sales.Orders
				GROUP BY YEAR(orderdate)) AS Prv
		ON Cur.orderyear = Prv.orderyear + 1;

	--2. COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION (CTEs)

		--As a simple example, the following code defines a CTE called USACusts
		--based on a query that returns all customers from the United States, and the outer query selects all
		--rows from the CTE.
			
			--My Solution
			--Any preceeding statement (in the same batch, if any) must be closed with a semi-colon when using WITH for CTEs
			WITH USACusts (custid,country,companyname)
			AS
			(
				--Use statement is not alllowed in here (example USE TSQL...) produced an erro, others might work need to experiment
				SELECT custid, country, companyname
				FROM Sales.Customers
				WHERE country = N'USA'

				--NB: The inner query must comply with  3 Table expresion conditions
			)
			SELECT custid,companyname,country FROM USACusts; 

			--Book solution
			WITH USACusts AS
			(
			SELECT custid, companyname
			FROM Sales.Customers
			WHERE country = N'USA'
			)
			SELECT * FROM USACusts;

		--Aliases with CTEs
				--inline
			WITH C AS
			(
				SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear, custid
				FROM Sales.Orders
			)
			SELECT orderyear, COUNT(DISTINCT custid) AS numcusts
			FROM C
			GROUP BY orderyear;

				--external	
			WITH C(orderyear, custid) AS
			(
				SELECT YEAR(orderdate), custid
				FROM Sales.Orders
			)
			SELECT orderyear, COUNT(DISTINCT custid) AS numcusts
			FROM C
			GROUP BY orderyear;
		
		--Defining Multiple CTEs
			--A CTE is defined before use, thus any subsequent CTEs and queries can reference.[Unlike derived queries where you had to define 
				--multiple instances of the query ] 
			--It takes a modular approach, making maintenance easy	

			--Alternative to the multiple definitions of derived queries above
			WITH C1 AS
			(
				SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear, custid
				FROM Sales.Orders
			),
			C2 AS
			(
				SELECT orderyear, COUNT(DISTINCT custid) AS numcusts
				FROM C1
				GROUP BY orderyear
			)
			SELECT orderyear, numcusts
			FROM C2
			WHERE numcusts > 70;

		--Multiple CTE references

		WITH YearlyCount AS
		(
			SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear,
			COUNT(DISTINCT custid) AS numcusts
			FROM Sales.Orders
			GROUP BY YEAR(orderdate)
		)

		Cur.numcusts - Prv.numcusts AS growth
		FROM YearlyCount AS Cur
			LEFT OUTER JOIN YearlyCount AS Prv
			ON Cur.orderyear = Prv.orderyear + 1;

		--Recursive CTEs

			--The following code demonstrates how to use
			--a recursive CTE to return information about an employee (Don Funk, employee ID 2) and all of the
			--employee�s subordinates in all levels (direct or indirect).

			--My Solution
